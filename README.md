FCSParser
=========

Python parser for FCS file format. Wrapped up for easy use.

The project was inspired by a project named FlowPy, a GUI FACS analysis tool written in Python. 
But FlowPy depends on Win32 libraries, making it unable to be transplanted to other OS. 

This project aims to make a FCS file parser for FACS analysis. This will only include the base classes for I/O and statistics.
I still don't have plans for developing a new GUI.
